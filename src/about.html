        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am Alpha Degago, a driven and ambitious individual with a passion for technology, blending a strong foundation in web development, data science, and economics. Currently studying Software Engineering, I combine technical expertise with a deep interest in solving real-world problems. I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, including work with the PERN stack, and have contributed to different real-world projects. Beyond my technical skills, I am a leader and mentor, serving as the Technical Team Leader for the Google Developer Group (GDG), mentoring young women in AI through Girls in AI, and actively contributing to the Innovation Center Management Team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I am a teenage leader and singer at my church, where I guide and inspire the youth. I also love hiking, finding peace and inspiration in nature. With a vision to support economic development in Ethiopia, I am dedicated to expanding my skills and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.
