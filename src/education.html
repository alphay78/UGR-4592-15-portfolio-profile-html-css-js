            <p>Thanks to my hard work in high school, I earned a place at Addis Ababa University. While I was excited to begin this journey, it turned out to be unexpectedly challenging.</p>
            <p>Making friends was difficult, and I faced many emotional struggles and sleepless nights. Despite these hardships, I stayed focused and achieved my goal of joining the software engineering department.</p>
            <p>Now, as a <strong>3rd-year Software Engineering student</strong>, I look back with gratitude for the resilience and perseverance these experiences have taught me.</p>

            <h2>My Self-Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>After joining the software engineering department, I quickly realized that learning was now my responsibility. Waiting for teachers to guide me was no longer an option, so I took charge of my own education.</p>
            <p>I taught myself skills like <strong>web development</strong>, <strong>graphic design</strong>, <strong>competitive programming</strong>, and <strong>AWS</strong>. This self-driven approach not only expanded my knowledge but also instilled a sense of independence and adaptability in my learning process.</p>
